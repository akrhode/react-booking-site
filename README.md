# react-booking-site

Responsive multi-page website built in React with Tailwind CSS for a fictitious agency called “ExpatDeals”.

<p>
Building this website put my knowledge about React components and props, the state hook, handling events, filtering arrays, transforming lists with the map-function, as well as React router components, routes, and links to the test.
<p> 
The website features:
<ul>
<li>a custom-built navbar and its mobile version, featuring React icons</li>
<li>a hero section with a full-screen video background</li>
<li>clickable images featuring an overlay and routes to further pages</li>
<li>a search bar with filtering function, allowing users to filter a series of cards by item name</li> 
<li>a booking section including a form with date input and drop-down selection</li>
<li>a custom-built slider/slideshow</li>
<li>a footer featuring React icons</li>
</ul>
